# Lab-Activity-2
I complete three activities in Java and HTML in this lab activity.

## CSV File
- [x] pick two columns from a csv file
- [x] sort them

I got my data from SpotifyCharts.com and got a unique list of artist names and song titles.

## Math Calculations
- [x] converts data from Fahrenheit to Celsius

If you enter a number for Fahrenheit, the degree in Celsius is shown.

## API
- [x] make a request to any API endpoint
- [x] return its contents

I used NASA's API to return the date and explanation.

# Reflection Over the Exercises
  1. Which programming languages did you use for each of these problems? 
  
        I used Java for the first exercise and HTML for the second and third.
        
  2. Why did you choose a particular language? (There is no right or wrong answer here, choosing an implementation is an art form)
  
        I used Java for the first exercise because I am familiar with the language and felt confident to complete the excercise with it. I chose HTML for the second         and third exercise because I learned HTML over the summer and did similar activities like the one I had done in this exercise. 
        
  3. Was there any difficult or easy about using that language for solving the problem?
  
        I am not that familiar with HTML, so the second and third activities were difficult for me. 
        
  4. If you had to solve the problem again, would you choose a different language?
  
        I am not that familiar with any other languages, so I would nto choose different languages.
